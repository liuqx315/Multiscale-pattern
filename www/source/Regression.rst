Regression Testing
====================

ARKode employs the `Jenkins <http://jenkins-ci.org/>`_ `continuous
integration system
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration>`_ to perform
regression testing of all checkins and pull requests on the `ARKode
development repository <https://bitbucket.org/drreynolds/arkode>`_.  
The current status of the development repository, as well as results
from all recent builds may be found at `this site
