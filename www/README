ARKode Webpage README

In this directory and below are the sources for the ARKode web
page. They are written using the ReST [1] formatting, which is parsed
into final formats using the Sphinx formatting engine [2].

To build the site, you must first have Sphinx [2] installed (version
1.1 or newer), as well as Python [3] (version 2.5 or newer).

To build the web site, use the command:
  $ make clean html
If that is successful, the ARKode web site will be located inside the
subdirectory build/html/ (relative to this directory).
