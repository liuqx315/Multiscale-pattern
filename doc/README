ARKode Documentation README
=============================

The ARKode documentation is in the subdirectories of this directory:
* guide -- the main ARKode documentation
* examples -- documentation of the ARKode examples

Both sets of documentation are written using the ReST [1] formatting,
which is parsed into final formats using the Sphinx formatting engine
[2].

Some benefits of using ReST + Sphinx include:

- ReST is very readable in its raw form. It has minimal mark-up
  and is in plain text.
- Since the document sources are included in the ARKode mecurial
  repository, all the documents are included with the code, and may
  therefore be rebuilt and accessed even without the internet.
- Sphinx can parse the documents into many convenient formats, most
  notably HTML and a PDF.


To build both forms of documentation, however, a number of packages
must be installed on your system.  These are detailed below.


Prerequisites:
--------------

To build the docs, you must first have Sphinx [2] installed (version
1.1 or newer), as well as Python [3] (version 2.5 or newer), and the
Sphinx Fortran "domain" extension [4].  To build the HTML version of
the documentation, you'll also need to install the Bootstrap Sphinx
Theme [5].

1. It is assumed that Python (version >= 2.5) is already installed on
   your system.

2. Installing Sphinx:

   a. The simplest way to install Sphinx is via the Python
      "easy_install" utility, if it is installed on your system:

      $ easy_install -U Sphinx

   b. The source code is also provided in the
      extra_packages/Sphinx-1.2b1.tgz file in the main
      arkode/doc directory.  Unpack that directory and install with
      the command

      $ sudo python ./setup.py install 

3. Installing the Sphinx Fortran "domain": 

   The source code is provided in the
   extra_packages/sphinx-fortran-extension.tgz file in the
   main arkode/doc directory.  Unpack that directory and install with
   the command 

      $ sudo python ./setup.py install 

4. Installing the Bootstrap Sphinx theme:

   a. The simplest way to install this package is via the Python
      "pip" utility, if it is installed on your system:

      $ pip install sphinx_bootstrap_theme

   b. The source code is also provided in the
      extra_packages/sphinx-bootstrap-theme.tgz file in the main
      arkode/doc directory.  Unpack that directory and install with
      the command

      $ sudo python ./setup.py install 

5. The manual installation approach for steps 2-4 may be automatically
   performed on an OSX or Linux system using the provided
   extra_packages/install_extensions.sh script in this directory.
   This script assumes that you have sudo permissions on a Linux or
   OSX system.  From within the extra_packages subdirectory,
   run the script via

      $ sudo ./install_extensions.sh
