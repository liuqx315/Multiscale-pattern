ARKode Example Documentation README
===================================

In this directory and below are the ARKode examples documentation. They
are written using the ReST [1] formatting, which is parsed into final
formats using the Sphinx formatting engine [2].

Here are some benefits of using ReST + Sphinx:

- ReST is very readable in its raw form. It has minimal mark-up
  and is in plain text.
- Since the document sources are included in the ARKode mecurial
  repository, all the documents are included with the code, and may
  therefore be rebuilt and accessed even without the internet.
- Sphinx can parse the documents into many convenient formats, most
  notably HTML and a PDF.


Prerequisites:
--------------

To build the example docs, you must first have Sphinx [2] installed
(version 1.1 or newer), as well as Python [3] (version 2.5 or newer).
To build the HTML version of the documentation, you'll also need to
install the Bootstrap Sphinx Theme [4].


1. It is assumed that Python (version >= 2.5) is already installed on
   your system.

2. Installing Sphinx:

   a. The simplest way to install Sphinx is via the Python
      "easy_install" utility, if it is installed on your system:

      $ easy_install -U Sphinx

   b. The source code is also provided in the
      extra_packages/Sphinx-1.2b1.tgz file in the main
      arkode/doc directory.  Unpack that directory and install with
      the command

      $ sudo python ./setup.py install 

3. Installing the Bootstrap Sphinx theme:

   a. The simplest way to install this package is via the Python
      "pip" utility, if it is installed on your system:

      $ pip install sphinx_bootstrap_theme

   b. The source code is also provided in the
      extra_packages/sphinx-bootstrap-theme.tgz file in the main
      arkode/doc directory.  Unpack that directory and install with
      the command

      $ sudo python ./setup.py install 

5. The manual installation approach for steps 2-3 may be automatically
   performed on a system using the provided
   extra_packages/install_extensions.sh script in the main arkode/doc
   directory, that assumes you have sudo permissions on a Linux or OSX
   system.  From within the arkode/doc/extra_packages directory, run
   the script via

      $ sudo ./install_extensions.sh



Building the documentation:
---------------------------

To build the documents in HTML, use the command:

      $ make html

If that is successful, open the file build/html/index.html in your web
browser (relative to this directory).

To build the documents in PDF (requires pdflatex [5] to be installed),
use the command: 

      $ make latexpdf

If this is successful, the PDF file will be located in
build/latex/ARKode_examples.pdf.  

If pdflatex is not functioning properly, you may instead try

      $ make latex

This will build the raw LaTeX source file
build/latex/ARKode_examples.tex, that you may then compile into a PS
or DVI file as desired. 

To remove the build/ directory entirely, or to clean up before
rebuilding the documentation, use the command:

      $ make clean
