Solver diagnostics output may be enabled through a call to
ARKodeSetDiagnostics.  All solver diagnostic output is written to the
supplied file pointer, with the following format.  Each line is
preceded by a string corresponding to the type of diagnostics output.
In the output file, the <> will not be included.

Step diagnostics:
"step  <step>  <h>  <stage>  <tn>"

* step gives the internal time step index; if a step fails for
  whatever reason, all successive attempts at the step will retain the
  same step index. 
* h is the time step width (uniform across multiple stage solves)
* stage is an integer corresponding to the current stage
* tn is the floating point stage solution time


Solver diagnostics:
"  lsetup"  
"    newt  <iter>  <del>  <dcon>"

* the "lsetup" line will only be displayed when lsetup is called
* the "newt" line will appear for each Newton iteration.
* iter is the Newton iteration index (resets at 0 when lsetup is called).
* del is the WRMS norm of the Newton correction.
* dcon is the convergence criteria (del * min(1.0,crate) / eLTE).


Error test diagnostics:
"  etest  <step>  <h>  <dsm>"

* these diagnostics will be printed whenever a step is complete and
  the accuracy error test will be performed.
* dsm is the error estimate computed within ARKComputeSolutions.


Adaptivity diagnostics:
"  adapt  <eh0>  <eh1>  <eh2>  <h_a>  <h_c>  <h_a2>  <h_c2>  <eta>"

* these diagnostics will be printed whenever ARKAdapt is called (both
  upon an error test failure for tightening h, and on a successful
  error test to estimate the new step size).
* eh0, eh1 and eh2 contain the error history array for the past 3 
  successful time steps, as filled in by ARKCompleteStep (i.e. dsm *
  ark_hadapt_bias).
* h_a and h_c are the accuracy and stability time step predictions, 
  prior to enforcement of any safety factors and growth bounds.
* h_a2 and h_c2 are the same time step restrictions, after enforcement 
  of all safety factors and growth/reduction bounds.
* eta is the final output growth factor for the time step size.
