ARKode Example Documentation README

In this directory and below are the ARKode examples documentation. They
are written using the ReST [1] formatting, which is parsed into final
formats using the Sphinx formatting engine [2].

Here are some benefits of using ReST + Sphinx:

- ReST is very readable in its raw form. It has minimal mark-up
  and is in plain text.
- Since the document sources are included in the ARKode mecurial
  repository, all the documents are included with the code, and may
  therefore be rebuilt and accessed even without the internet.
- Sphinx can parse the documents into many convenient formats, most
  notably HTML and a PDF.

To build the docs, you must first have Sphinx [2] installed (version
1.1 or newer), as well as Python [3] (version 2.5 or newer).  To build
the HTML version of the documentation, you'll also need to install the
Bootstrap Sphinx Theme [4].

To build the documents in HTML, use the two commands:
  $ make clean
  $ make html
If that is successful, open the file build/html/index.html in your web
browser (relative to this directory).

To build the documents in PDF (requires pdflatex [5] to be installed),
use the two commands: 
  $ make clean
  $ make latexpdf
If this is successful, the PDF file will be located in
build/latex/ARKode_examples.pdf.  

If pdflatex is not functioning properly, you may instead try
  $ make clean
  $ make latex
This will build the raw LaTeX source file build/latex/ARKode_examples.tex, that
you may then compile into a PS or DVI file as desired.
