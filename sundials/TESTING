To test sundials you have to use the cmake build system with examples enabled.

To do so use the following commands:

mkdir <build directory>
cd <build directory>
cmake <sundials directory> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix> -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<prefix> -DEXAMPLES_ENABLE=ON
make
make test

This will create an out of source build, build sundials and all the examples, and
run the tests (which are the examples).

CMake has built in support for running tests in a nice and readable fashion which
has been utitilized.  The current test system uses a test runner (test/testRunner)
to run the tests and compare the output to checked in answers (test/answers) 
which are deemed correct by the sundials team.  The test runner saves the current
output to test/output; this is overwritten everytime "make test" is run.  If an example
fails you may need to look at "<build directory>/Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log" which is
the an output file created by CMake and saves all of the console output which "make test"
hides from you.

If a test needs command line arguments or a different level of precision for integers
or floating point comparison, they are read in from test/testInfo.  The format is
explained in that file.
