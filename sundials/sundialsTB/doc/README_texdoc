     Instructions for Generating sundialsTB.ps and sundialsTB.pdf

The texdoc.m script assumes use of the m2html package, which is freely
available at: http://www.artefact.tk/software/matlab/m2html/

To get started, download the package (m2html.zip) and install it (with
unzip) in a matlab directory.

Then, in the matlab directory, make two subdirectories in the
m2html/templates directory titled: 'latex' and 'sundialsTB'.

Next, copy the files from sundials/sundialsTB/doc/tex_files/stb_template/
into the m2html/templates/latex subdirectory.

Similarly, copy the files from sundials/sundialsTB/doc/html_files/stb_template/
into the m2html/templates/sundialsTB subdirectory.

Finally, to run texdoc.m, start Matlab in the directory sundials/sundialsTB/doc.
At the Matlab prompt, add the m2html location to the Matlab path by executing:
>> addpath ~/matlab/m2html
or by doing a similar specification of the location of the m2html package.
Then (within Matlab) type 'texdoc' and (when finished) quit Matlab.

This results in files sundialsTB.ps and sundialsTB.pdf in the directory
sundials/sundialsTB/doc.  It also generates a working directory tex/ there,
with various auxiliary files.

At this point, the file sundialsTB.pdf must be copied to two other places:
(a) Copy it to sundials/doc/sundialsTB/ in order to enable the tar-script to
include it in the distribution tar-file.
(b) Copy it to sundials/html/documentation/ in order to make it available
for installation on the SUNDIALS website.
