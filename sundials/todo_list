To Do List for SUNDIALS, as of 12/17/2014

(*** items must be completed before KINSOL and ARKode can be released.)

***(Alan) Pull recent revisions into user guides and READMEs as appropriate

***(Carol) SuperLU_MT for all solvers

***(Carol, Steve) KLU for all solvers

***(Carol) pcg and FGMRES for all solvers, documentation

***(Carol) Document sparse solvers

***(Carol/Eddy) IM release of KINSOL and ARKode...in progress 12/17/14

***(Carol/Eddy) Update tarscripts

***(Carol) Update xfig diagrams

***(Carol) Update recent revisions - all to comment

***(Carol, Steve) Note on Windows build

***(Eddy) Update options for cmake.  Remove autoconf documentation in 
manuals and INSTALL_NOTES (anywhere else?)

***(Eddy) Add last modified date to each file from SVN

***(Steve) Finalize pthreads implementation and document performance concerns.

***(Steve) Write and test openMP and pThreads with Fortran and document

	   Tests written.
	   Need to document.

***(Steve) Document KLU build options

(Alan, Carol) Verify output of examples used in new testing system 
are indeed correct.
As part of this we probably should tighten absolute tolerances on Krylov
example codes as there is a good bit of variation on consecutive parallel runs
and even between systems.  Maybe try abstol = 10^-6?

(Alan, Carol) Review vector documentation

(Alan) Review header info for all files

(Alan) Review build documentation.

(Alan) Review new xfig diagrams

(Carol) Examples of pcg and FGMRES for all solvers

(Eddy) Remove autoconf from build system

(Eddy) Make build system handling of examples consistent.  Right now, distclean
does not remove compiled examples.  Also, the install builds an examples
directory, but the executables are not copied there.

(Eddy) C++ example for each solver

(Steve) Look into whether there is any issue with MPI and differing parallel
results in consecutively run parallel examples.

***(Eddy) Remove autotools build files from installation

***(Eddy) NVector test examples are not installed correctly. They contain multiple .c source
   files that need to be installed and accounted for in installed Makefile.
   
*** (Eddy) Document NVector use in install guide

*** (Eddy) C++ conditional statements in wrong place with respect to #include lines

*** (Eddy) Nightly build should compile with '-Wall' and '-ansi -pendantic' to force ISO 90 behavior.
    Plus all errors/warnings should be fixed
    
*** (Alan) Identify any outstanding user issues.

*** (Alan) Create individual user guide skeleton code example to show only one flavor of p, t, o, s and
    infer the others. Main skeleton should continue to show all four.
    
*** (Alan) Create cvDiag example with MPI

*** (Eddy) Document CMake support is for LINUX Makefile system only (although can be used to configure other systems)

*** (Eddy) Documentation figures need square/round edges as specified in the text

*** (Eddy) Remove old auto test code from current ongoing versions in repo

*** (Eddy) Ida figure should show Nvector (as does in Main).  All individual solver figures
    to be updated in same way as Ida
    
*** (All) Test, test, test

Deferred to after release (11/6/13)
  
Update all Matlab interfaces

(LEB, 7/30/13) When running tests (i.e. testRunner) the 'output' 
directory is built within the source tree - don't want anything in source tree.  The output
should be built in the 'Testing' directory relative to the directory in which 'make test' is run.

Enhancement to testing.  The ordering of tests would be better if core
features where tested before biggger tests.  For example nvector tests
are currently last but would be better to identify failures in them
first.  If vector impls have a bug rest of library will not work.

Enhancement to testing.  Should test the install process; say do a
link to the installed library for an example program.  Currently it is
possible to forget to include a header file for in the tarscript.
Perhaps entire test suite could be setup to build against the install
directory or development directory?

*** Attach nightly build log file to log file to email sent to developers

*** Nightly build should build all libraries (SuperLU_MT, LAPACK etc) and test all examples - will
    require multiple build capability since not all libraries can be built simultaneously.

*** Nightly build should run regression tests with valgrind

*** Determine tool / method for either documenting in LaTex and converting to HTML (preferred)
    or document HTML 'markup' and convert to LaTex etc.
    
*** Refactor duplicated code from ida/idas and cvode/cvodes into common module

*** Need hybrid mpi/openmp example

*** Look into issue tracking system open to developers and users

*** Nightly build should use tarscript(s) to install/test

*** Generate 'local' set of tolerances to enable 'tighter' nightly testing.
    Perhaps enable this as a feature for users to generate tolerances.

Completed Tasks


***(Dan) Add documentation for ARKode into SUNDIALS distribution

***(Carol) Add error flag checks for KLU

***(Carol) Add optional ordering Set routine for SuperLU_MT and KLU for 
all solvers

(Alan) Provide better guidance as to exactly what the from of the Jacobian is
for use adding a new linear solver.  Math considerations in IDA indicates
the Jacobian is dF/dy + alpha dF/dydot.  But, alpha is not defined and
cj is teh variable in the IDA structures that the user needs for this.
CVODE likely also has similar disconect but I did not check this.

(Carol, Steve, David, Dan) Develop a set of unit tests for the vector 
kernel operations.  This 
set of tests should be something a user could employ to verify 
their own vector kernel is correct.  (Of course, ours should pass these
tests!)

(Dan, Eddy) Need to add ARKode to SUNDIALS' automated testing infrastructure.

***(Steve) Change header info for all files
       Script was run which fixes most file headers.
       Following should find all files that still need to be updated.
       grep Regents $(find . -type f) | grep -v 2013 | grep -v .svn | grep -v .hg | awk ' BEGIN {FS=":"} {print $1}'
