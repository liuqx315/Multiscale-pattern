To Do List for SUNDIALS, as of 11/6/13

(*** items must be completed before KINSOL and ARKode can be released.)

***(Alan) Pull recent revisions into user guides and READMEs as appropriate

***(Carol) SuperLU_MT for all solvers

***(Carol, Steve) KLU for all solvers

***(Carol) pcg and FGMRES for all solvers, documentation

***(Carol) Document sparse solvers

***(Carol) IM release of KINSOL and ARKode

***(Carol) Update tarscripts

***(Carol) Update xfig diagrams

***(Carol) Update recent revisions - all to comment

***(Carol, Steve) Note on Windows build

***(Dan) Add documentation for ARKode into SUNDIALS distribution

***(Eddy) Update options for cmake.  Remove autoconf documentation in 
manuals and INSTALL_NOTES (anywhere else?)

***(Eddy) Add last modified date to each file from SVN

***(Steve) Finalize pthreads implementation and document performance concerns.

***(Steve) Write and test openMP and pThreads with Fortran and document

	   Tests written.
	   Need to document.

***(Steve) Document KLU build options

***(Steve) Change header info for all files

	   Script was run which fixes most file headers.

	   Following should find all files that still need to be updated.

	   grep Regents $(find . -type f) | grep -v 2013 | grep -v .svn | grep -v .hg | awk ' BEGIN {FS=":"} {print $1}'


(Alan, Carol) Verify output of examples used in new testing system 
are indeed correct.
As part of this we probably should tighten absolute tolerances on Krylov
example codes as there is a good bit of variation on consecutive parallel runs
and even between systems.  Maybe try abstol = 10^-6?

(Alan, Carol) Review vector documentation

(Alan) Review header info for all files

(Alan) Review build documentation.

(Alan) Review new xfig diagrams

(Carol) Examples of pcg and FGMRES for all solvers

(Eddy) More rigorous build system testing - please elaborate
(Eddy) Remove autoconf from build system

(Eddy) Make build system handling of examples consistent.  Right now, distclean
does not remove compiled examples.  Also, the install builds an examples
directory, but the executables are not copied there.

(Eddy) C++ example for each solver

(Steve) Look into whether there is any issue with MPI and differing parallel
results in consecutively run parallel examples.

Deferred to after release (11/6/13)
  
Update all Matlab interfaces

(LEB, 7/30/13) When running tests (i.e. testRunner) the 'output' 
directory is built
within the source tree - don't want anything in source tree.  The output
should be built in the 'Testing' directory relative to the directory in
which 'make test' is run.

Extend testrunner to test more than one configuratino of 
SUNDIALS - individual solver builds, w/ and w/out SuperLU_MT and/or KLU,
etc.

Enhancement to testing.  The ordering of tests would be better if core
features where tested before biggger tests.  For example nvector tests
are currently last but would be better to identify failures in them
first.  If vector impls have a bug rest of library will not work.

Enhancement to testing.  Should test the install process; say do a
link to the installed library for an example program.  Currently it is
possible to forget to include a header file for in the tarscript.
Perhaps entire test suite could be setup to build against the install
directory or development directory?

Completed Tasks


***(Carol) Add error flag checks for KLU

***(Carol) Add optional ordering Set routine for SuperLU_MT and KLU for 
all solvers

(Alan) Provide better guidance as to exactly what the from of the Jacobian is
for use adding a new linear solver.  Math considerations in IDA indicates
the Jacobian is dF/dy + alpha dF/dydot.  But, alpha is not defined and
cj is teh variable in the IDA structures that the user needs for this.
CVODE likely also has similar disconect but I did not check this.

(Carol, Steve, David, Dan) Develop a set of unit tests for the vector 
kernel operations.  This 
set of tests should be something a user could employ to verify 
their own vector kernel is correct.  (Of course, ours should pass these
tests!)

(Dan, Eddy) Need to add ARKode to SUNDIALS' automated testing infrastructure.
