\chapter{Generic Linear Solvers in SUNDIALS}\label{s:gen_linsolv}
%===================================================================================
In this section, we describe five generic linear solver code modules that 
are included in {\ida}, but which are of potential use as generic packages in
themselves, either in conjunction with the use of {\ida} or separately.
