\chapter{IDA Installation Procedure}\label{c:install}

The installation of {\ida} is accomplished by installing the
{\sundials} suite as a whole, according to the instructions that
follow.   The same procedure applies whether or not the downloaded
file contains solvers other than {\ida}.\footnote{Files for both the
serial and parallel versions of {\ida} are included in the distribution.
For users in a serial computing environment, the files specific to parallel
environments (which may be deleted) are as follows:
all files in \id{src/nvec\_par/};
\id{nvector\_parallel.h} (in \id{include/nvector/});
\id{ida\_bbdpre.c, ida\_bbdpre\_impl.h} (in \id{src/ida/});
\id{ida\_bbdpre.h} (in \id{include/ida/}); 
\id{fidabbd.c, fidabbd.h} (in \id{src/ida/fcmix/});
all files in \id{examples/ida/parallel/};
all files in \id{examples/ida/fcmix\_parallel/}.
(By ``serial version'' of {\ida} we mean the {\ida} solver with the
serial {\nvector} module attached, and similarly for ``parallel version''.)}
