\chapter{CVODE Installation Procedure}\label{c:install}

The installation of {\cvode} is accomplished by installing the
{\sundials} suite as a whole, according to the instructions that
follow. The same procedure applies whether or not the downloaded
file contains solvers other than {\cvode}.\footnote{Files for both the
serial and parallel versions of {\cvode} are included in the distribution.
For users in a serial computing environment, the files specific to parallel
environments (which may be deleted) are as follows:
all files in \id{src/nvec\_par/};
\id{nvector\_parallel.h} (in \id{include/nvector/});
\id{cvode\_bbdpre.c, cvode\_bbdpre\_impl.h} (in \id{src/cvode/});
\id{cvode\_bbdpre.h} (in \id{include/cvode/}); 
\id{fcvbbd.c, fcvbbd.h} (in \id{src/cvode/fcmix/});
all files in \id{examples/cvode/parallel/};
all files in \id{examples/cvode/fcmix\_parallel/}.
(By ``serial version'' of {\cvode} we mean the {\cvode} solver with the
serial {\nvector} module attached, and similarly for ``parallel version''.)}
