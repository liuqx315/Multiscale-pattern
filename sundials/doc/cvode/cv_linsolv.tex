\chapter{Generic Linear Solvers in SUNDIALS}\label{s:gen_linsolv}
%===================================================================================
In this chapter, we describe seven generic linear solver code modules that 
are included in {\cvode}, but which are of potential use as generic packages in
themselves, either in conjunction with the use of {\cvode} or separately.
