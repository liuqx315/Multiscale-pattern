\index{KINSOL@{\kinsol}!package structure}
The {\kinsol} package is written in the ANSI {\C} language. This section
summarizes the basic structure of the package, although knowledge
of this structure is not necessary for its use.

The overall organization of the {\kinsol} package is shown in Figure
\ref{f:kinorg}.

  Modules specific to {\kinsol} are distinguished by rounded boxes, while
  generic solver and auxiliary modules are in rectangular boxes.

The central solver module, implemented in the files
\id{kinsol.h}, \id{kinsol\_impl.h} and \id{kinsol.c}, deals with the solution
of a nonlinear algebraic system using either an Inexact Newton method or a
line search method for the global strategy. Although this module contains logic
for the Newton iteration, it has no knowledge of the method used to solve the
linear systems that arise. For any given user problem, one of the linear system
modules is specified, and is then invoked as needed.

\index{KINSOL@{\kinsol} linear solvers!list of|(}
At present, the package includes the following seven {\kinsol} linear algebra
modules, organized into two families. The {\em direct} family of linear
solvers provides solvers for the direct solution of linear systems with
dense, banded, or sparse matrices and includes:
\begin{itemize} 
\item {\kindense}: LU factorization and backsolving with dense matrices
  (using either an internal implementation or Blas/Lapack); 
\item {\kinband}: LU factorization and backsolving with banded matrices
  (using either an internal implementation or Blas/Lapack); 
\item {\kinklu}: LU factorization and backsolving with
  compressed-sparse-column (CSC) matrices using the KLU linear solver
  library \cite{KLU_site};
\item {\kinsuperlumt}: LU factorization and backsolving with
  compressed-sparse-column (CSC) matrices using the threaded
  SuperLU\_MT linear solver library \cite{SuperLUMT_site}.
\end{itemize}
The {\em spils} family of linear solvers providess scaled preconditioned
iterative linear solvers and includes:
\begin{itemize} 
\item {\kinspgmr}: scaled preconditioned GMRES method;
\item {\kinspbcg}: scaled preconditioned Bi-CGStab method;
\item {\kinsptfqmr}: scaled preconditioned TFQMR method.
\end{itemize}
The set of linear solver modules distributed with {\kinsol} is intended to be expanded in the
future as new algorithms are developed.
\index{KINSOL@{\kinsol} linear solvers!list of|)}

In the case of the direct methods {\kindense} and {\kinband} the
package includes an algorithm for the approximation of the Jacobian by
difference quotients, but the user also has the option of supplying
the Jacobian (or an approximation to it) directly.
When using the sparse direct linear solvers {\kinklu} and
{\kinsuperlumt}, the user must supply a routine for the Jacobian (or an
approximation to it) in CSC format, since standard difference quotient
approximations do not leverage the inherent sparsity of the problem.
In the case of the Krylov methods {\kinspgmr}, {\kinspbcg} and {\kinsptfqmr},
the package includes an algorithm for the approximation by difference quotients of the
product between the Jacobian matrix and a vector of appropriate length. Again, the user
has the option of providing a routine for this operation.
For the Krylov methods, \index{preconditioning!setup and solve phases}
the preconditioning must be supplied by the user, in two phases:
setup (preprocessing of Jacobian data) and solve.

\index{KINSOL@{\kinsol} linear solvers!implementation details|(}
Each {\kinsol} linear solver module consists of four routines, devoted to (1)
memory allocation and initialization, (2) setup of the matrix data
involved, (3) solution of the system, and (4) freeing of memory.
The setup and solution phases are separate because the evaluation of
Jacobians and preconditioners is done only periodically during the
integration, as required to achieve convergence. The call list within
the central {\kinsol} module to each of the associated functions is
fixed, thus allowing the central module to be completely independent
of the linear system method.
\index{KINSOL@{\kinsol} linear solvers!implementation details|)}

\index{generic linear solvers!use in {\kinsol}|(}
These modules are also decomposed in another way.
Each of the linear solver modules ({\kindense}, etc.) consists of an
interface built on top of a generic linear system solver ({\dense}
etc.).  The interface deals with the use of the particular method in
the {\kinsol} context, whereas the generic solver is independent of
the context.  While some of the generic linear system solvers
({\dense}, {\band}, {\spgmr}, {\spbcg}, and {\sptfqmr}) were written
with {\sundials} in mind, they are intended to be usable anywhere as
general-purpose solvers.  This separation also allows for any generic
solver to be replaced by an improved version, with no necessity to
revise the {\kinsol} package elsewhere. 
\index{generic linear solvers!use in {\kinsol}|)}.

{\kinsol} also provides a preconditioner module called {\kinbbdpre} for use
with any of the Krylov iterative liear solvers. It works in conjunction
with {\nvecp} and generates a preconditioner that is
a block-diagonal matrix with each block being a band matrix, as
further described in \S\ref{sss:kinbbdpre}.

All state information used by {\kinsol} to solve a given problem is saved
in a structure, and a pointer to that structure is returned to the
user.  There is no global data in the {\kinsol} package, and so in this
respect it is reentrant. State information specific to the linear
solver is saved in a separate structure, a pointer to which resides in
the {\kinsol} memory structure. The reentrancy of {\kinsol} was motivated
by the anticipated multi-computer extension.
