\chapter{KINSOL Installation Procedure}\label{c:install}

The installation of {\kinsol} is accomplished by installing the
{\sundials} suite as a whole, according to the instructions that
follow. The same procedure applies whether or not the downloaded
file contains solvers other than {\kinsol}.\footnote{Files for both
the serial and parallel versions of {\kinsol} are included in the
distribution. For users in a serial computing environment, the files
specific to parallel environments (which may be deleted) are as follows:
all files in \id{src/nvec\_par};
\id{nvector\_parallel.h} (in \id{include/nvector/});
\id{kinbbdpre.c, kinbbdpre\_impl.h} (in \id{src/kinsol/});
\id{kinbbdpre.h} (in \id{include/kinsol/});
\id{fkinbbd.c, fkinbbd.h} (in \id{src/kinsol/fcmix/});
all files in \id{examples/kinsol/parallel/};
all files in \id{examples/kinsol/fcmix\_parallel/}.
(By ``serial version'' of {\kinsol} we mean the {\kinsol} solver with the
serial {\nvector} module attached, and similarly for ``parallel version''.)}
