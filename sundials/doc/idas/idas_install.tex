\chapter{IDAS Installation Procedure}\label{c:install}

The installation of {\idas} is accomplished by installing the
{\sundials} suite as a whole, according to the instructions that
follow.   The same procedure applies whether or not the downloaded
file contains solvers other than {\idas}.\footnote{Files for both the
serial and parallel versions of {\idas} are included in the distribution.
For users in a serial computing environment, the files specific to parallel
environments (which may be deleted) are as follows:
all files in \id{src/nvec\_par/};
\id{nvector\_parallel.h} (in \id{include/nvector/});
\id{idas\_bbdpre.c, idas\_bbdpre\_impl.h} (in \id{src/idas/});
\id{idas\_bbdpre.h} (in \id{include/idas/});
all files in \id{examples/idas/parallel/}.
(By ``serial version'' of {\idas} we mean the {\idas} solver with the
serial {\nvector} module attached, and similarly for ``parallel version''.)}
