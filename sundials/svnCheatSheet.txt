1 . For the initial checkout of entire SUNDIALS, do
     'svn checkout file:///usr/casc/sundials/svnrepo/trunk sundials'

2.  svn checkout sundials/...
     Checkout any part of current sundials repository.
     Rename existing directory or SVN files to avoid an overwrite.
     Existing files with non-SVN names will remain unaffected.

3.  svn diff file
     Do this at any point to get the differences between the local file
     and the SVN repository version.  Lines marked "-" and "+" show
     old and new versions, resp.

4.  svn diff -r 3740:3746 user_issues
     show differences of version 3740 compared with version 3746 of file user_issues

5.  svn diff -r 3740:3746 examples
     show all the differences (between revision 3740 and 3746) in examples directory

6.  svn diff -r 3740:3746 .
     Use '.' to to show difference in current directory

7.  svn diff -c 3746 user_issues
     Show changes made to file: user_issues for specific commit

8.  svn status 
     Gives listing of new files (denoted with ?), modified files (M), and deleted files (D).
     New files or deleted files must be added or removed using the add and delete commands.
     Files that have been added, but not yet commited, are denoted with an 'A'.

9.  After modifying a file or files, do: svn commit file  OR
     svn commit file1 file2 ...  to renew it in SVN.  Do this within
     the subdirectory containing the file or files.  Alternatively, do
     svn commit sundials/.../file (one file at a time) from top level.
     This gives an emacs window in which to enter comments on the revision.
     Enter comments, then do 'Ctrl-S Ctrl-C' to exit.

     You will notice that when you commit a file the revision of the repo is incremented.
     But your local copy is NOT. So when you commit, you should follow up with an
     svn update which will simply update the revision of your local copy.

     The typical commit procedure is:
      1) update your local copy to ensure you have the latest changes from the repository
      2) test your changes for desired results (and to ensure all still works)
      3) commit your changes
      4) do 'svn update' at the top level to 'update' your local revision number 

10.  svn log file
     Gives a revision history on file.

11.  svn info
     Show revision of local working copy along with the repository
     root to which you are connected.

12.  svn info file:///usr/casc/sundials/svnrepo/trunk
     Shows revision of trunk project in repository

13.  svn list -v
      Verbose list of contents of svn directory showing commit revision
      and owner and date.

14.  svn list -v file:///usr/casc/sundials/svnrepo/trunk
      List contents of sundials project in repository

15.  svn add file_or_dir_name
      When you add a new file or directory to a project that has been checked out
      you must tell Subversion to include that file or directory in its version control.
      After adding to version control, the addition can be commited to repository.

16.  svn delete file_or_dir_name
      Remove a file or directory from versioning. Must still commit to reflect the deletetion
      in the repository. Note: previous revisions will retain the file or directory. 

17.  For documents, enter into SVN:
     (a) the source files (*.tex) needed, and
     (b) the *.eps files for figures required.
     Do not enter the .ps or .pdf files.  But in local directory, keep the
     *.pdf files for use in the website and for making tar-files for
     distribution, as called for by the tar-script.
     When replacing a figure .eps file, remove the old one, then add the
     new one, to avoid creation of a large diff file. (Best to always keep the old - 
     if you don't want the file treated as a text file - then file can be marked as
     binary to avoid merges and diffs).

18.  svn update OR svn update sundials/...
     Do this each time I do a new development or testing in my local space,
     to update all local files that are out of date.  If old versions are
     needed, do a copy first.  This does NOT get files that were newly
     added to the structure.  Updated files are listed with a label U.
     NOTE: If present local copy clashes with repository (older) version,
     'svn update' will produce a changed version (marked C) with clashes
     delimited by <<<<< and >>>>> lines. To be safe, rename the file and do
     a fresh update of it.

19. svn rename file_or_dir_name
      Renames file or directory. Commit will update the next revision in the repository
      with the new file name. The previous revision will retain the old file name.
