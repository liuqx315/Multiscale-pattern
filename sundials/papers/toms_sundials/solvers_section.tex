\section{The Basic Solvers}\label{s:basic_solvers}

In this section we overview each of the three core solvers in
SUNDIALS, giving a detailed summary of the methods and algorithms used
in each.  Although many of the algorithmic features are common to the
three codes (e.g., finite-difference Jacobian-vector approximations
and stopping criteria), we still outline them with respect to each
package, as some of the details in their implementation are different.

All three of the solver descriptions below involve a number of
heuristic rules, safety factors, and the like.  We do not attempt to
justify or explain these heuristics here, for two reasons.  First,
most of them are largely arbitrary, and have little or no solid
mathematical basis.  For example, a safety factor less than 1 is
needed in many places (such as in step size selection based on
estimated local error), but we know of no good argument for preferring
any particular value over another.  (In a few cases, some performance
testing was done to optimize heuristic parameters, but this is rare.)
The second reason is that all of these heuristics were inherited from
earlier solvers, and the documentation of those solvers includes some
discussion of the heuristics used.  Each of the three descriptions
cites the appropriate earlier literature.
