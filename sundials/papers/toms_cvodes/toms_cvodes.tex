\begin{abstract}
CVODES, which is part of the SUNDIALS software suite,
is a stiff and nonstiff ordinary differential equation initial 
value problem solver with sensitivity analysis capabilities. 
CVODES is written in a data-independent manner, with a highly 
modular structure to allow incorporation of different 
preconditioning and/or linear solver methods. It shares with the 
other SUNDIALS solvers several common modules, most notably the 
generic kernel of vector operations and a set of generic linear 
solvers and preconditioners.

CVODES solves the IVP by one of two methods -- backward differentiation 
formula or Adams-Moulton -- both implemented in a variable-step, 
variable-order form. The forward sensitivity module in CVODES implements 
the simultaneous corrector method, as well as two flavors of 
staggered corrector methods. Its adjoint sensitivity module 
provides a combination of checkpointing and cubic Hermite interpolation 
for the efficient generation of the forward solution during the adjoint 
system integration.

We describe the current capabilities of CVODES, its design principles,
and its user interface.  We also give an example problem to illustrate
the performance of CVODES.
