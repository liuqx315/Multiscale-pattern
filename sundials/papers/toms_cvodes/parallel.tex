\section{Parallel  Example Problem}\label{s:parallel}

The most preeminent advantage of CVODES over existing sensitivity solvers is
the possibility of solving very large-scale problems on massively parallel 
computers. To illustrate this point we present speedup results for the 
integration and forward sensitivity analysis for
an ODE system generated from the following 2-species diurnal
kinetics advection-diffusion PDE system in 2 space dimensions: 
\begin{equation}
  \frac{dc_i}{dt} = K_h \frac{d^2c_i}{dx^2} + v \frac{dc_i}{dx} 
  + K_v \frac{d^2c_i}{dz^2}
  + R_i(c_1, c_2, t) \, , \quad \text{for } i=1,2 \, ,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    R_1(c_1,c_2,t) &= -q_1 c_1 c_3 - q_2 c_1 c_2 + 2 q_3(t) c_3 + q_4(t) c_2 , \\
    R_2(c_1,c_2,t) &=  q_1 c_1 c_3 - q_2 c_1 c_2 - q_4(t) c_2 \, ,
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
$K_h$, $K_v$, $v$, $q_1$, $q_2$, and $c_3$ are constants, and $q_3(t)$ and $q_4(t)$
vary diurnally.   
The problem is posed on the square
$0 \le x \le 20$, $30 \le z \le 50$   (all in km),
with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, and for time t in
$0 \le t \le 86400$ (1 day).
The PDE system is treated by central differences on a uniform
mesh, except for the advection term, which is treated with a biased
3-point difference formula.
The initial profiles are proportional to a simple polynomial in $x$
and a hyperbolic tangent function in $z$.

The solution with CVODES is done with the BDF/GMRES method (i.e.
using the CVSPGMR linear solver) and the block-diagonal part of the 
Newton matrix as a left preconditioner. A copy of the block-diagonal
part of the Jacobian is saved and conditionally reused within the
preconditioner setup function.

The problem is solved by CVODES on $P$ processors, treated as a 
rectangular process grid of size $p_x \times p_z$.
Each processor contains a subgrid of size $n = n_x \times n_z$ of the 
$(x,z)$ mesh.  Thus the actual mesh size is 
$N_x \times N_z = (p_x n_x) \times (p_z n_z)$,
and the ODE system size is $N = 2 N_x N_z$.

Parallel performance tests were performed on ASCI Frost, a 68-node, 16-way SMP system
with POWER3 375 MHz processors and 16 GB of memory per node.
Speedup results for a global problem size of
$N = 2 N_x N_y = 2 \cdot 1600 \cdot 400 = 1280000$ 
shown in Fig.~\ref{f:speedup}.
We present timing results for the integration of only the state equations
(column STATES), as well as for
the computation of forward sensitivities with respect to the diffusion coefficients
$K_h$ and $K_v$ using the staggered corrector method without and with 
error control on the sensitivity variables (columns STG and
STG\_FULL, respectively). 
%%
We note that there was not enough memory to solve the problem (even without
carrying sensitivities) on fewer processors.

The departure from the ideal line of slope $-1$ is explained by the 
interplay of several conflicting processes. On one hand, when increasing the 
number of processors, the preconditioner quality decreases, as it incorporates 
a smaller and smaller fraction of the Jacobian and the cost of inter-process 
communication increases. On the other hand, decreasing the number of processors
leads to an increase in the cost of the preconditioner setup phase and to a larger
local problem size which can lead to a point where a node starts memory paging to disk.
