README info for setting up and running the nightly build/test for SUNDIALS

Initial setup:
  The SUNDIALS devtest directory should be exported from svn (currently into
  /usr/casc/sundials on the Tux system)
  > cd /usr/casc/sundials
  > svn export file:///usr/casc/sundials/svnrepo/trunk/devtest
  
  Change group ownership to nsde:
  > chgrp -R nsde devtest
  
  Set group id to enable inheritance of group ownership:
  > chmod -R g+s devtest
  
  Make sunbuild.py executable:
  > chmod +x devtest/bin/sunbuild.py
  
  The sunbuild.py script - will attempt to extract, build, and test the current
  revision from the sundials repo trunk.
  To run the build manually:
  > source /usr/casc/sundials/devtest/bin/sunset.sh
  > /usr/casc/sundials/devtest/bin/sunbuild.py


To run script automatically every night from cron:
  Edit your personal crontab:
  > crontab -e
  
  Add entry to run the sunbuild.py script (example runs at 2:15 AM every day)
  15 2 * * * . /usr/casc/sundials/devtest/bin/sunset.sh;
               /usr/casc/sundials/devtest/bin/sunbuild.py

 
NOTES:
  The 'nightly' directory on same level as bin, is required to exist by the script.
  This directory will have all the revision checkouts and builds.
 
Installing a new version of sunbuild.py and/or sunset.sh:
  The SUNDIALS devtest directory must be exported with the 'force' option to
  overwrite the files:
  > cd /usr/casc/sundials
  > svn export --force file:///usr/casc/sundials/svnrepo/trunk/devtest

  Both sunset.sh and sunbuild.py are marked as executable in SVN. If not:
  > chmod +x devtest/bin/sunset.sh
  > chmod +x devtest/bin/sunbuild.py
