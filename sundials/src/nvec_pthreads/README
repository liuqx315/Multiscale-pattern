                     NVECTOR_OPENMP
               Release 1.0.0, October 2013


OpenMP implementation of the NVECTOR module for SUNDIALS. 

NVECTOR_OPENMP defines the content field of N_Vector to be a structure 
containing the length of the vector, a pointer to the beginning of a 
contiguous data array, and a boolean flag indicating ownership of the 
data array.

NVECTOR_OPENMP defines five macros to provide access to the content of 
a openmp N_Vector, several constructors for variables of type N_Vector,
a constructor for an array of variables of type N_Vector, and destructors
for N_Vector and N_Vector array.

NVECTOR_OPENMP provides implementations for all vector operations defined
by the generic NVECTOR module in the table of operations.


A. Documentation
----------------

The openmp NVECTOR implementation follows the serial implemenation
fully described in the user documentation for any of the SUNDIALS
solvers [1-5]. A PDF file for the user guide for a particular solver
is available in the solver's subdirectory under doc/.


B. Installation
---------------

For basic installation instructions see /sundials/INSTALL_NOTES. 
For complete installation instructions see any of the user guides.
