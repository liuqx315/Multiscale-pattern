                  NVECTOR_PARALLEL_GRID
                Release 2.5.0, March 2012


MPI parallel implementation of the NVECTOR module for SUNDIALS, for
multi-dimensional regular grids with optional ghost zones at each face. 

NVECTOR_PARALLEL_GRID defines the content field of N_Vector to be a
structure containing the global length of the vector, arrays
containing the total and active array lengths along each dimension, an
array containing the offset from the start of any dimension to that 
dimension's active data, a pointer to the beginning of a contiguous
local data array, an MPI communicator, and a boolean flag indicating
ownership of the data array, and a boolean flag indicating whether the
array uses Fortran (first-index-fastest) or C (last-index-fastest)
ordering.  

NVECTOR_PARALLEL_GRID defines several macros to provide access to the 
content of a parallel grid N_Vector, several constructors for
variables of type N_Vector, a constructor for an array of variables of
type N_Vector, and destructors for N_Vector and N_Vector array.

NVECTOR_PARALLEL_GRID provides implementations for all vector
operations defined by the generic NVECTOR module in the table of
operations. 


A. Documentation
----------------

The MPI parallel grid NVECTOR implementation is fully described in the
user documentation for any of the SUNDIALS solvers [1-5]. A PDF file
for the user guide for a particular solver is available in the
solver's subdirectory under doc/. 


B. Installation
---------------

For basic installation instructions see /sundials/INSTALL_NOTES. 
For complete installation instructions see any of the user guides.
